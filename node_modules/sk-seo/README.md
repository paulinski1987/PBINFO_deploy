## Standard Parameters
| Parameter     | Description             | Type | Default             |

| `description`| The description of the page | string | ~ |

All these choices are optional
| Parameter     | Description             | Type | Default             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `siteName`| The name of the site | string | ~ |
| `canonical`| Current URL of the page. For resolving duplicate pages with SEO | string | ~ |

| `schemaOrg`| Indicates whether jsonLd/SchemaOrg meta script should be generated | boolean | false |

## How it works
The component uses `<svelte:head>` to place meta tags that are filled with sveltekit $page and inputted variables, this means that a lot of the tags are automatically filled for you for each page in your website. An example of this is `og:url`, which requires the url of the current page:
```svelte
<meta property="og:url" content="{$page.url}">
```

## Extendable
If you want to use an unusual meta tag or use your own custom one (eg: google site verification). It's easy as:
```svelte
<Seo title="abc" description="def">
  <meta name="google-site-verification" content="abcd123">
</Seo>
```

## Why
A lot of SEO is repeated boilerplate for twitter, open graph and schemaOrg. This component's sole purpose is to do away with all the annoyances and just help you focus on your content without having to spend hours making sure all the meta tags are correctly set on each and every page.

I initially made this for my personal website and decided to open source it to so that no one has to go through the headache I did to make sure everything is functional.

## Keywords?!
It's optional for anyone who wants to use it. Google doesn't rely on keywords anymore but apparently bing still does put a tiny weight on it. I personally use keywords for my personal website's search function.

## Duplicated Meta?
If you're behind `Cloudflare` and find yourself with duplicated meta tags, then you should disable auto-minify!

`Speed -> Optimization -> Content Optimization -> Auto Minify -> UNCHECK HTML`
