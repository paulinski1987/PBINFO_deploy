When I first found Paul, he came over to see the project and gave me a price breakdown of materials needed and labour's costs. There were even times it went over the original estimate but didn't charge extra, which was very reasonable on his end. He has done many home projects for me over the years. Cleaned my gutters, done my outdoor water spouts, built my backyard fence, rebuild my deck, changed my chandler's, and my most recent large project of making a bathroom from scratch. He built the walls, installed the shower, toliet and sink. He does it all!",
