I have never been a fan of sifting through a long-winded introduction when I already know what I'm looking for, so let's get straight to what's important to a homeowner.

I provide a wide range of interior and exterior maintenance, repair and renovation services. I know that aesthetics are just as important as functionality and take a lot of pride in the quality of my work.

I am fully insured, I fulfill my commitments, fairness and honesty are important to me.

You can get an overview of some of the work I can do (plus some nifty images) in the Services section. If you do not see what you need listed the Contact page has a convenient service request form. I do my best to respond to all requests the same day they are made, preferably within a few hours.

The About section has testimonials from some of my valued clients as well as a small section about myself. 

Thank you for considering my services. I hope to hear from you soon!
